The Jokisivu gold deposit formed in a brittle-ductile shear zone and gold mineralization is related to the youngest deformation stage.\\n\\nThe main focus of this study was in fluid inclusions in quartz veins. Quartz grains host fluid inclusions that carry information of the prevailing P\u2013T\u2013X conditions during fluid events in the quartz veins. According to the properties of fluid inclusion assemblages (FIA), six fluid inclusion types were distinguished. Fluid inclusion types A1, A2 and A3 are aqueous and fluid inclusion types B1, B2 and B3 are aqueous\u2013carbonic. Relative chronology of the fluid inclusion types was determined by cross cutting relationships of fluid inclusion assemblages. Relative chronology of fluid inclusion types from oldest to youngest is A1, A2 and A3, B3, B1 and B2 indicating that aqueous fluids came in first and aqueous\u2013carbonic fluids followed them.\\n\\nMicrothermometry was conducted for all the FIAs. The melting point of CO2 was generally below the CO2 triple point ranging from -59.15\u00b0C to -56.73\u00b0C indicating the presence of other gaseous phases that were later confirmed with Raman spectroscopy to be CH4, N2 and even H2S. Raman spectroscopy was conducted for qualitative analysis of the phases presentn the inclusions.\\n\\nQuartz crystallization temperatures were calculated using titanium in quartz geothermometer (TitaniQ). TitaniQ was well suited for Jokisivu samples because titanium concentrations in the hydrothermal quartz were quite constant. Combining TitaniQ P\u2013T slopes and fluid inclusion assemblage isochores from microthermometry and Raman spectroscopy yielded a good estimate for P\u2013T conditions of fluid entrapment of 390\u2013470\u00b0C and 170\u2013345 MPa. The estimated temperature range is higher than the previous studies have suggested. However, the P\u2013T range estimated for Jokisivu is in accordance with the P\u2013T conditions of other Svecofennian orogenic gold deposits.\\n\\nJudged by the mineralogy of the quartz vein - host rock contact, the most important factor triggering gold precipitation in Jokisivu has probably been fluid-rock interaction. Strong sulfidation of host rock reduced the sulfur fugacity and enabled gold precipitation.", "faculty": "matlu", "charcount": 110402, "commonwords": [["fluid", 391], ["quartz", 239], ["inclusion", 225], ["gold", 199], ["inclusions", 141], ["et", 139], ["al", 135], ["sample", 88], ["samples", 86], ["raman", 84], ["jokisivu", 84], ["veins", 83], ["2010", 76], ["temperatures", 67], ["co2", 65], ["grains", 65], ["rock", 64], ["vein", 64], ["host", 63], ["fig", 63]], "keywords": "fluid evolution, fluid inclusion, fluid inclusion assemblage, fia, titaniq geothermometry, p-t conditions, , fluidievoluutio, fluidisulkeuma, titaniq geotermometri, paine-l\u00e4mp\u00f6tilaolot, jokisivu, proterotsooinen", "unit": "Matemaattis-luonnontieteellinen tiedekunta, Geotieteiden ja maantieteen laitos", "status": "master", "thesistype": "Pro gradu -ty\u00f6", "pagecount": 87, "title": "Fluid evolution of the Paleoproterozoic Jokisivu orogenic gold deposit, SW Finland", "language": "en", "author": "Kuusela, Tytti", "date": "2016-11-14", "distinctwords": 3197}
