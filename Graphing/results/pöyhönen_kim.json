In particular, they are theorized to\\nsupport Majorana bound states, a type of quasiparticle with several interesting properties \u2013 most\\nnotably, they exhibit nonabelian exchange statistics, which has applications in fault tolerant quantum\\ncomputing. During the past few years, several groups have observed effects in topological\\nsuperconductors indicating that an experimental confirmation of their existence may be imminent.\\nRecently experimental focus has been on ferromagnetic systems with spin-orbit coupling, serving as\\nthe motivation for our research.\\nIn this thesis, we study the topological properties of a system consisting of magnetic adatoms\\nimplanted on a two-dimensional superconducting substrate with Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Starting\\nfrom the mean-field Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian, we derive a nonlinear eigenvalue problem\\ndescribing the system, generalizing previous results which considered a linearized version. In the\\nreciprocal space, we obtain a transcendental equation for the energy of the system. Through\\nnumerical solution of these equations in the limit of long coherence length we obtain the topological\\nphase diagram of the system. We further analyse the spatial decay of the Majorana wavefunctions as\\nwell as the dependence of their energy splitting on the length of the adatom chain.\\nAs an application, we study a prototype topological qubit constructed by intersecting two\\none-dimensional adatom chains to obtain a cross-shaped geometry that supports two pairs of\\nMajorana bound states. The design allows for braiding of the individual quasiparticles, providing a\\npossible platform for experimental verification of their nonabelian exchange statistics. Using numerical\\nmethods, we simulate moving the topological phase boundaries to enact a braid of two Majorana\\nbound states and calculate the system energy for each step. We find that throughout the process the\\nzero-energy modes are separated from the bulk states by a finite energy gap, as required for adiabatic\\nbraiding.', 'Vain tiivistelm\u00e4.
