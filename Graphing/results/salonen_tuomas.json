The described methods aim to ease the work of a forensic\\nchemist who is tasked with comparing two samples of a drug, such as amphetamine, and delivering\\nan answer to a question of the form \u201dAre these two samples from the same source?\u201d \\nAdditionally,\\nmore statistical rigour is introduced to the process of comparison.\\n\\nThe chemical profiles consist of the relative amounts of certain impurities present in seized\\ndrug samples. In order to obtain such profiles, the amounts of the target compounds must be\\nrecovered from chromatographic-mass spectrometric measurements, which amounts to searching\\nthe raw signals for peaks corresponding to the targets. The areas of these peaks must then be\\nintegrated and normalized by the sum of all target peak areas.\\n\\nThe automated impurity profile extraction presented in this thesis works by first filtering\\nthe data corresponding to a sample, which includes discarding irrelevant parts of the raw data,\\nestimating and removing signal baseline using the asymmetrical reweighed penalized least squares\\n(arPLS) algorithm, and smoothing the relevant signals using a Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter. The\\nSG filter is also used to estimate signal derivatives. These derivatives are used in the next step to\\ndetect signal peaks from which parameters are estimated for an exponential-Gaussian hybrid peak\\nmodel. The signal is reconstructed using the estimated model peaks and optimal parameters are\\nfound by fitting the reconstructed signal to the measurements via non-linear least squares methods.\\nIn the last step, impurity profiles are extracted by integrating the areas of the optimized models for\\ntarget compound peaks. These areas are then normalized by their sum to obtain relative amounts of the substances.\\n\\nIn order to separate the peaks from noise, a model for noise dependency on signal level was\\nfitted to replicate measurements of amphetamine quality control samples non-parametrically.\\nThis model was used to compute detection limits based on estimated baseline of the signals.\\n\\nFinally, the classical Pearson correlation based comparison method for these impurity profiles was compared to two Bayesian methods, the Bayes factor (BF) and the predictive agreement(PA). The Bayesian methods used a probabilistic model assuming normally distributed values with\\nnormal-gamma prior distribution for the mean and precision parameters. These methods were\\ncompared using simulation tests and application to 90 samples of seized amphetamine.", "faculty": "matlu", "charcount": 90124, "commonwords": [["data", 142], ["peak", 139], ["signal", 118], ["samples", 82], ["used", 76], ["compound", 75], ["peaks", 72], ["methods", 70], ["comparison", 70], ["given", 66], ["model", 64], ["impurity", 64], ["corresponding", 61], ["ion", 60], ["sample", 58], ["method", 57], ["noise", 57], ["values", 56], ["parameters", 53], ["target", 53]], "keywords": "predictive agreement, bayes factor, locally linear regression, chromatography, r software", "unit": "Matemaattis-luonnontieteellinen tiedekunta, Matematiikan ja tilastotieteen laitos", "status": "master", "thesistype": "Pro gradu -ty\u00f6", "pagecount": 79, "title": "An Automatic Method for Extracting Chemical Impurity Profiles of Illicit Drugs from Chromatoraphic-Mass Spectrometric Data and Their Comparison Using Bayesian Reasoning", "language": "en", "author": "Salonen, Tuomas", "date": "2017-03-06", "distinctwords": 2604}
