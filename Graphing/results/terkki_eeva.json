The number of clicks received on the advertisements (ads) and thus\\nthe revenue gained from them can be increased by showing targeted ads to users. Mobile\\nadvertising networks collect a variety of privacy sensitive information about users and use it\\nto build advertising profiles. To target ads at individual users based on their interests, these\\nadvertising profiles are typically linked with the users\u2019 unique device identifiers, such as the\\nadvertising ID used in Android.\\n\\nAdvertising profiles may contain a large amount of privacy sensitive information about\\nusers, which can attract adversaries to attempt gaining access to this information. Mobile\\ndevices are known to leak privacy sensitive information such as device identifiers in clear text.\\nThis poses a potential privacy risk, since an adversary might exploit the leaked identifiers\\nto learn privacy sensitive details about a victim by sampling personalized ads targeted at\\nthe victim.\\n\\nThis thesis explores the behavior of mobile ad networks regarding data collection and ad\\ntargeting, as well as the possibility of an attack where leaked device identifiers are exploited\\nto request ads targeted at a victim. We investigated these problems in the context of four\\npopular Android ad libraries that support ad targeting, using a custom app and simulated\\nuser profiles designed for this purpose.\\n\\nOur findings indicate that it is possible to use sniffed identifiers to impersonate another\\nuser for requesting ads, and to some degree, this can result in receiving ads specific to the\\nvictim\u2019s profile. In the case of some ad networks, the lack of ad targeting causes it to be\\ninfeasible to conduct an attack to request ads targeted at the victim.', 'Vain tiivistelm\u00e4.
